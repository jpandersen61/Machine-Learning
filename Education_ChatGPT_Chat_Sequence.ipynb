            "\n",
            "3. **Web Development**\n",
            "   - Concentrates on developing skills necessary for building and maintaining websites and web applications. This includes learning about web programming languages, user interface design, and user experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Multimedia Design and Communication**\n",
            "   - This program is ideal for those interested in the intersection of technology and design. It covers web design, digital aesthetics, communication strategies, and multimedia tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Data Science and Big Data Analytics** \n",
            "   - Focused on teaching how to analyze large volumes of data to make informed decisions. This includes learning about statistics, machine learning, and using tools like Python and R.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Cyber Security**\n",
